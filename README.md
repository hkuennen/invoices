## Automating the creation and emailing of invoices as PDF files

Run the `main.py` file to update an existing invoice (not included in the repo) with the current invoice number and date.
The terminal asks for the invoice number as user input.
The program will then call the `emailing.py` script to send an automated email to the specified receiver email address.
You can furthermore modify the email body and attachment name.
